# Discord-Bot-Client

## Hi!
My name is Shayaan. I made this app so people can use discord bots pretty easily. 

## ðŸŒŒ How to use 

Step 1. Download a .jar from releases (If you don't see one yet, just wait for a bit. I'll add them soon!)
Step 2. In the area you're running the .jar, create a file called token.txt. This is where you will insert a Discord Bot "password."
Step 3. Create a discord bot. Follow the instructions [here](https://javacord.org/wiki/getting-started/creating-a-bot-account.html#how-to-add-a-bot-to-your-server).
Step 4. Have fun!
